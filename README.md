# Heart-Disease-Analysis

This is a data science learning project where we will work with the heart disease dataset (available in this repository) and proceed with the following:  
-Analyse the data by choosing relevant metrics and plotting them  
-Build some machine learning models, train them, test them and then choose whichever has the best accuracy  
-Make prediction on new data with the best model  
-Save the model
